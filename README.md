# Drowsiness-Detector
Hey guys! This is my project to determine whether a driver is asleep or not while driving. It does trigger an alarm when the drive is asleep. I used opencv with help Haar cascades to do a face scan and create region of interest(ROI).Then using a model trained on CNN with 3 conv2d layer and categorical crossentropy loss function to do the prediction part.
You can see the dataset used to train our model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sMuPIpRrpdl4ejeeVSCHwgXwxo0sK513?usp=sharing) and haar cascade files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zSGuFogywbB9FW2leUFsg6O0Lp6fpR7O?usp=sharing). I request you to go through our brochure and manual once. 
Go ahead and try for yourself!! and if you face any difficulty or have any suggestions, feel free to write me at rituraj161100@gmail.com.
