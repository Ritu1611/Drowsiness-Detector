# Drowsiness-Detector
Hey guys! This is my project to determine whether a driver is asleep or not while driving. It does trigger an alarm when the drive is asleep. I used opencv with help Haar cascades to do a face scan and create region of interest(ROI).Then using a model trained on CNN with 3 conv2d layer and categorical crossentropy loss function to do the prediction part
You can see the dataset used to train our model [here](). I request you to go through our brochure and manual once. 
Go ahead and try for yourself!!
